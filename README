O'Radar - Obnoxious Lingr Radar

O'Radar is yet another Lingr Radar application.  If you don't know what
Lingr Radar is for, you can stop reading this and Google about it.

This is a fairly bad copy of the original Lingr Radar and I don't recommend
you to use this.  Only good thing of this application is that it's an open
source application so that you can fix or improve whatever you desire.  Unless
you are willing to hack this, you don't have to bother using this.

Any comments, suggestions, or criticism are always welcome.
